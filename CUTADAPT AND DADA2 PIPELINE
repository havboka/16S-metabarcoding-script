#--------------------------------------------------------#
#--- Cutadapt & Dada2 Pipeline for metabarcoding data ---#
#--------------------------------------------------------#

# Code from John Pearman (john.pearman@cawthron.org.nz)
# Altered by Jacqui Stuart for Small sub-unit (SSU) v9 data-set
# Altered by Salvatore Campanile for 16S amplicon sequencing analysis of V4 region of 16S rRNA gene

# Date 2025.07.28
# Primer pair: 515Fm and 806Rm for V4 region of prokaryotic 16S
#Sequenced completed by Azenta Life Science (https://www.azenta.com/)

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

## Sequence Pipeline

# This R script delineates a comprehensive metabarcoding data processing workflow, encompassing library installation, 
# data organization, primer analysis, Cutadapt-based trimming, Dada2 quality checks, filtering, and chimera removal.
# Utilizing checkpoints ensures adaptability in handling interruptions or errors.

# Subsequently, the script navigates through pivotal steps: "Merging seqtab files," which consolidates tables from
# various sequencing runs based on gene region (v9 or v4), and saves them as .rds files. The "Taxonomy" section processes merged
# tables, metadata, and taxonomy files, crafting phyloseq objects.

# Addressing contamination, the "Subtracting negative controls" segment deducts sequences from negative controls, adjusting
# the main data accordingly. The script then eliminates zero samples, creating a new phyloseq object without negative controls.

# Concluding with a comparison of count sums, the script saves the cleaned dataset as .rds and tracks removed sequences
# in a CSV. It culminates by emphasizing the preparedness of the cleaned data for community and diversity analysis.

### Mergin seqtab files ###

# This is to be run when you have multiple sequencing runs that were split to run through the your pipeline
# Only merge seqtab files of the same gene region
# Next step after this is taxonomy

#--- Set working directory ---#
setwd("C:/Users/user/Documents/R") #CHANGE ME

#--- Read in seqtab files ---#
# Here I am defining the name of each data table `seqtab.nochim.file.name` 
# The reading in the existing sequence table for each sequence run using `readRDS()`
# make sure to change the file path to match where your files are!

# v9 region sequence tables
seqtab.nochim.CAW.23.21 <- readRDS("C:/Users/user/Documents/R/CAW-23-21_v9_seqtab.nochim.rds") # CHANGE ME

#----------------------------#
##### Merge seqtab files #####
#----------------------------#

# define input table groups
v9_tables <- list(seqtab.nochim.CAW.22.11, seqtab.nochim.CAW.23.21)  # CHANGE ME

# Merge all v9 region sequence tables
v9.seqtab.merge <- mergeSequenceTables(tables = v9_tables)  # CHANGE ME
#check new file rownames order
rownames(v9.seqtab.merge)  # CHANGE ME

# Save `.rds` file of each merged table to working directory
saveRDS(v9.seqtab.merge, "C:/Users/user/Documents/R/2023-06-01_v9_merged-seqtab.nochim.rds")  # CHANGE ME

# Now you should have a new merged sequence table in your working directory, or the filepath you defined above
# Woohoo, all done.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
### Taxonomy ###
# Here we combine the taxonomy and sample metadata files and
# remove negative control sample data from the data set. Then you will have a delightful clean data-set
# You need to have a metadata file at this point that will have all the base information associated with your sequenced samples. 


#--- Read in data ---#
### CHANGE ME: Make sure file path and name is correct!!!

#--- V4 ---#
# read in `seqtab.nochim` file from your working directory
v4.seqtab.nochim <- readRDS("/home/salvatorecampanile/merged and chimera free files/seqtab.nochim.rds")  #Loads the merged, chimera-free ASV table

# read in metadata
v4.metadata <- read.csv("/home/salvatorecampanile/SIPL sampling Antarctica 2024.csv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1) #Loads your sample metadata CSV

# assign taxonomy once you have uploaded the database on your main directory
v4.taxonomy <- assignTaxonomy(
  seqtab.nochim,
  "/home/salvatorecampanile/silva_nr99_v138.2_toSpecies_trainset.fa.gz",
  multithread = TRUE
)

# Save it so you can load it later (then the `readRDS()` line will make sense)
saveRDS(v4.taxonomy, "/home/salvatorecampanile/v4.taxonomy.rds")


# read in taxonomy
v4.taxonomy <- readRDS("/home/salvatorecampanile/v4.taxonomy.rds") #Loads the assigned taxonomy for your ASVs

# check that sample names in the ASV table match metadata

#first of all, if you need to trim the name of your samples, you can simply run this bunch of lines:
# Clean the sample names to retain only the first two parts split by "-"
clean_names <- sapply(strsplit(rownames(v4.seqtab.nochim), "-"), function(x) paste(x[1], x[2], sep = "-")) #this is for the nochim files

# Assign the cleaned names back to the sequence table
rownames(v4.seqtab.nochim) <- clean_names


#NOW CHECK IT AGAIN

#This returns the list of sample names (usually from your sequencing files) that are used as row names in your chimera-free sequence table.
rownames(v4.seqtab.nochim) 

#  This returns the list of sample names from your metadata CSV file, usually containing things like sample type, location, treatment, etc.
rownames(v4.metadata)

# run this to check if their names match before doing any analysis
all(rownames(v4.seqtab.nochim) %in% rownames(v4.metadata)) #if it comes out FALSE you need to change one of the two (check above)


#now we can finally merge the threee files linking my samples, the table with all the infrmations anf finally the dataset we would like to use:

library(phyloseq) #upload this again if necessary

v4 <- phyloseq(
  otu_table(v4.seqtab.nochim, taxa_are_rows = FALSE),
  sample_data(v4.metadata),
  tax_table(v4.taxonomy)
)

rank_names(v4) #necessary to check all the taxa division
